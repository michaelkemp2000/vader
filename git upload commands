Managed to get git going and pushed to github

Create a Git account
Create a repository (in my case, I called it vader)
goto command line on console
	first you have to clone your repository that you created online
	git clone https://github.com/michaelkemp2000/vader.git

	next you move the code into the local instance of your reposiktory you just cloned
	cp ex20.py .git/vader/

	Next you got to your local repository
	cd .git/vader/

	Then you add the files in the direcory to staging, in this case I had README and the 1 file, so i used period and did not call out the specific file
	git add .

	Then I commited the code ready for upload
	git commit -m 'Exercise 20 - Git commit test'

	Finally I pushed to the repository vader @ github
	git push origin master


COURSE NOTES:
-------------

Distributed Version control.

Issues in your reporsitor is for conversation - Bugs, ideas:

	Setting tab if your owner of the repository, you need to add colabourators


GITHUB flow (Branch)

Master is the deplotable code.

Should branch out for various testing in a safe place

Commit - make chages, add code

Pull request - Other people can comment review.  Make sure everyone is happy

Merge - deploy back to master

Storing local repositories: michaelkemp2000/git_repositories
