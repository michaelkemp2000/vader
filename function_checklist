1.  Did you start your function with def?

2.  Does your function name have only characters and _(underscore) characters?

3.  Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the function name )

4.  Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis ( seperated by commas?

5.  Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicate names)?

6.  Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon ): after the arguments?

7.  Did you indent all the lines of code you want in the function four spaces? no more, no less.

8.  Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting we call it)?

And when you run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:

1.	Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name

2.  Did you put the ( character after then name to run it?

3.  Did you put the value you want into the parenthesis, seperated by commas?

4.  Did you end the function call with a ) character?

Use these two checklist on the remains lessons until you do not need them anymore.
Finally, repeat this a few times:  "To 'run,' 'call,' or 'use' a function all mean the same things."
