1.  Did not add quotes in this line so program could not detect a string value

originally:
print "Its fleece was white as %s." % snow

Fixed:
print "Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow'

2.  Did not add quotes around this variable declaration

formatter = %r %r %r %r

Should have been:

formatter = "%r %r %r %r"

3. Did not add comma between these strings:

(
"I had this thing."
"That you could type up right."
"But it didn't sing."
"So I said goodnight."
)

Should gave been:

(
"I had this thing.",
"That you could type up right.",
"But it didn't sing.",
"So I said goodnight."
)
